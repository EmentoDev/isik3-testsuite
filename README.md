## About The Project
This is a test suite for conformance tests of the ISiK Stufe 3 specification modules:

- [Basis](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-basis-v3?version=current)
- [Medikation](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-medikation-v3?version=current)
- [Terminplanung](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-terminplanung-v3?version=current)
- [Dokumentenaustausch](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-dokumentenaustausch-v3?version=current)
- [Vitalparameter und Körpermaße](https://simplifier.net/guide/isik-vitalparamater-v3?version=current)

### Release Notes
See [ReleaseNotes.md](./ReleaseNotes.md) for all information regarding the (newest) releases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the test suite you need the following components:

1. This test suite, which you can get either by cloning this repository or downloading the latest release.
2. An ISiK resource server (System under Test, SUT) that is compliant with one of the ISiK Stufe 3 specification modules.

Operating system requirements: cf. [Tiger Framework OS requirements](https://gematik.github.io/app-Tiger/Tiger-User-Manual.html#_requirements)

### Installation

#### Test environment
Configure the endpoint of the SUT using the configuration element `servers.fhirserver.source` in the `tiger.yaml` configuration file. Example:

```yaml
servers:
#...   
  fhirserver:
    type: externalUrl
    source:
      - http://localhost:9032
```

See examples for different configuration options in the [tiger.yaml](./tiger.yaml) or check the official [Tiger documentation](https://gematik.github.io/app-Tiger/Tiger-User-Manual.html) 

#### Test resources

Each test case requires specific test resources to be present in the SUT. Create the following test resources in the SUT and put their corresponding IDs into the `testdata/MODULENAME.yaml` configuration file. 

Example:

The `@Patient-Read` test case requires a patient resource to be created in the SUT by the user before the test case can be run. As the SUT would usually assign a new unique ID to each created resource, e.g. `244b0d72-fe47-4294-be48-7763895287c5`, this newly assigned ID should be put into the `testdata/basis.yaml` configuration file. The precondition of the test case declares which configuration variable should be used - `patient-read-id` in this example:  

```yaml
...
patient-read-id: Patient-Read-Example
...
```

## Usage

### Using Maven

Edit the file `.env` to select the test cases you want to run (see [.env](./env) for examples). The default value is all tests from the ISIK basis module. 

Afterward call Maven to execute the tests:

```shell
mvn clean verify
```

#### Proxy settings

If using the tiger testsuite behind a proxy provide the proxy configuration at the following places:
1. Maven configuration ([official documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html).
2. `tiger.yaml` (`forwardToProxy` configuration block)

### Using Docker

The testsuite is also distributed as a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gematik1/isik3-testsuite). Make sure, the docker environment has a connection to the SUT (configure [docker proxy settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/cli/proxy/) if needed). 

To use the image, download and adjust the following files according to your test environment:
* `tiger.yaml` (configuration of the test environment and test framework)
* `dc-testsuite.yml` (configuration of the docker container)
* `.env` (configuration of the test suite)
* `testdata/*.yaml` (configuration of test data per module)

Then start a docker container using docker-compose:

```shell
docker compose -f dc-testsuite.yml up
```

## Inspecting test results

Right after starting a test suite a browser window will open, which provides an overview of the testing progress. If using Tiger in Docker, please navigate to http://localhost:9010 manually. See [Tiger Workflow UI](https://gematik.github.io/app-Tiger/Tiger-User-Manual.html#_tiger_user_interfaces) for further information about the user interface. To run the test suite without the GUI, e.g. within a CI/CD pipeline, set the configuration element `lib.activateWorkflowUi` to `false` in the `tiger.yaml` configuration file.

After the test suite finishes the archived test results can be found in `tiger-integration-isik-stufe-3-VERSION-debug-report.zip` file (take notice of the `debug-report` suffix) or `target/site/serenity/index.html` in case of a Maven run.

> **Warning**
> Each test run deletes the reports of the previous run. Backup the created reports if you need them in the future.

## Submitting test results as part of the ISiK certification process
The artifact  `target/tiger-integration-isik-stufe-3-VERSION-test-report.zip` is required to apply for the [ISiK conformance certificate](https://fachportal.gematik.de/informationen-fuer/isik/bestaetigungsverfahren-isik) (take notice of the `test-report` suffix). Please [get an account](https://fachportal.gematik.de/gematik-onlineshop/titus?ai%5Baction%5D=detail&ai%5Bcontroller%5D=Catalog&ai%5Bd_name%5D=111&ai%5Bd_pos%5D=2) to the TITUS platform and upload the report into the corresponding submission form.

> **Warning**
> Each test run deletes the reports of the previous run. Backup the created reports if you need them in the future.
