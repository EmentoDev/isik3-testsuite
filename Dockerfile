#We recommend to use a base image of the same version as the tiger version you are using in your project.
# This ensures that the tiger dependencies are already loaded into the local maven repository.

# Optional: if you need a different dependency script, overwrite the one inside the base image
# -chown is needed because the COPY command will otherwise copy the file as root
COPY --chown=tiger-testsuite . /app

RUN mvn clean dependency:go-offline verify -DskipTests -ntp

# The base image executes as an entry point the command mvn clean verify in the /app folder. And afterwards
# it copies an existing *report.zip from /app/target/*report.zip to /app/report/
# Currently your project needs to ensure the zip files is created
# You can define your own ENTRYPOINT which will override the one from the base image
# Command to be executed.
